/*
Source: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataWordWrap
You write a class called Wrapper, that has a single static function named wrap that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number.
The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number.

Like a word processor, break the line by replacing the last space in a line with a newline.

Solution can assume that no word is longer than the maximum number characters in a line.
